# Landing page

This is a second project in TOP (The Odin Project) course.

We want to replicate layout of the landing page shown in the image 01.png.
02.png describes what fonts, colors our project should use.

To expand my knowledge I also used Bootstrap and Tailwindcss libraries.

In folder html_css we find implementation using HTML+CSS.

In folder bootstrap we find implementation using bootstrap CSS.
